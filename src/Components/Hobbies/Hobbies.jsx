      <h1>What I like Doing / What Interests Me</h1>
      <p> Not really a hobby but I've been into craisins recently. </p>
      <p> Books </p>
      <p>
        I've just started really comitting to reading on a consistent basis and
        I've been loving it. I ended up reading about 20 books last year and
        this year I finally finished Infinite Jest My current top three
        recommended books are: Americanah, The Death And Life of Great American
        Cities and Predictibly Irrational. My GoodReads account for more!

      <p> Music </p>
      <p>
        Big music patrician, one of my favourite bands is Neutral Milk Hotel.
        I've recently been in a very big Mid Western Pop Punk Revival phase. My
        two best playlists I think are a hip-hop focused "Roll Deep" and a much
        more meloncholy "its time 2 be sad"
      </p>
      <p> Philosophy </p>
      <p>
        The Philosophize This! Podcast really made me fall in love with
        Philosophy and a lot of the reason why I've been getting into reading is
        to get a better a grip on all of it. One of my favourite course I took
        in university was a philosophy of mind class, I still have the textbook
        on my bookshelf.

      <p> Youtube </p>
      <p>
        Big youtube fan, grew up with Youtube. For the past couple of years I've
        started to really enjoy video essays. Some of my favourite from, Big
        Joel, Lindsay Ellis & ContraPoints.
