title: "Who Am I?"
---

I'm currently working as a full stack developer living in Toronto! I'm still very new to the industry as I've only been working full time for a couple of years and I still have an incredible amount to learn.

Currently what I like using is: [React](https://reactjs.org/) (Went to ReactConf 2019, probably will talk to you at length about the genius design of react), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). As well, I am a recent TypeScript convert (I just hope it stays in fashion for more than a couple years, RIP CoffeeScript).

Although I'm full stack, my passion & enthusiasm comes from the UX side of development. People are fascinating and for me when it comes to technology nothing is more interesting than how we use it, react to it and evolve along side of it.
