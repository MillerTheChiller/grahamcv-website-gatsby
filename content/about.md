title: "Who Am I?"
firstdraft: I know this observation is nowhere even close to the ballpark of original but I always find it interesting how the first thing we always tend to say when we meet each other is what we do for work. Fully a product of the capitalist structure we live in and the commodification of our lives combined with the status we attribute and the identity we sacrifice to our jobs.

I'm currently a full stack developer living in Toronto! I'm still very new to the industry as I've only been working full time for a couple of years and I still have an incredible amount to learn. Currently what I like using is [React](https://reactjs.org/) (Went to ReactConf 2019, probably will talk to you at length about the genius design of react), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

Although I'm full stack, my passion & enthusiasm comes from the UX side of development. People are fascinating and for me when it comes to technology nothing is more interesting than how we use it, react to it and evolve along side of it.
