title: "Who Am I?"
firstdraft: I'm a 24 year old living in Toronto. I'm also finding it incredibly hard to not have the second sentence of this section be what I do for work and the coding languages I like working with. I know this observation is nowhere even close to the ballpark of original but I always find it interesting how the first thing we always tend to say when we meet each other is what we do for work. Fully a product of the capitalist structure we live in and the commodification of our lives combined with the status and identity we sacrifice to our jobs.

I'm a 24 year old living in Toronto. I've been a full stack developer for just over two (2) years. I'm still very new to the industry and I still have an incredible amount to learn. Currently what I like using is [React](https://reactjs.org/) (Went to ReactConf 2019, probably will talk to you at length about the genius design of react), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

Although I'm full stack, my passion & enthusiasm comes from the UX side of development. People are fascinating and for me when it comes to technology nothing is more interesting than how we use it, react to it and evolve along side of it.
