Big music patrician, one of my favourite bands is [Neutral Milk Hotel](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/how-neutral-milk-hotels-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea-became-a-polarizing-cult-classic/). I've recently been in a very big [Mid Western Pop Punk Revival phase](https://open.spotify.com/album/3JbWR6CUfTLMRnlFFH2YJk?si=kRFcVWyEQruUrHsZ-p0Rig). My two (2) favourite playlists I've made are the hip-hop focused [Roll Deep](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0n8SD2wPcdacbPbEneWUq8?si=vKOkOGTDTRKU0sKPoQPZAg) and the much more melancholy [its time 2 be sad](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1juWKLSp2zpR3A6Jv1tPCl?si=W3PyYOOhTv-ni9Hnjs-Zlg).
