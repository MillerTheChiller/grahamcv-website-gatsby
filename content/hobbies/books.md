I've just started really comitting to reading on a consistent basis and I've been loving it. I ended up reading about twenty (20) books last year and this year I finally finished [Infinite Jest](https://www.pastemagazine.com/books/david-foster-wallace/why-insufferable-people-love-infinite-jest/)! My current top three (3) recommended books are: [Americanah](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15796700-americanah), [The Death and Life of Great American Cities](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30833.The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities), and [Predictably Irrational](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1713426.Predictably_Irrational).
