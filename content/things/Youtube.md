Big youtube fan, grew up with Youtube. For the past couple of years I've started to really enjoy video essays. Some of my favourite current 'YouTubers' are: [HBomberGuy and his two hour analysis about niche games I'll never actually play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsNm2YLrk30&t=7122s), [ContraPoints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJW4-cOZt8A) & [Big Joel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eOr58c9rRg).
